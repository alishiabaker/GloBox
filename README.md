# GloBox
GloBox project
GloBox has been primarily known for their boutique fashion items and high-end decor products. 
However, they have recently expanded substantially in their food and drink products and would 
like to bring more awareness to these areas in order to increase overall revenue.  
I have conducted an analysis using A/B testing in order to gain insight on whether a new food 
and drink banner on the companyâ€™s mobile website would increase the conversion rate and overall 
revenue. Upon my research, I explored the difference in conversion rate amongst both groups A 
(control) and B (treatment) and found an increase of .71%. Which indicates that including the banner 
on the landing page would be beneficial for GloBox.  I also remarked on a positive correlation 
with the average amount spent per user. Group A had an average of $3.37 per user and group B had
an average of $3.39 per user, displaying an overall increase of $.05. Based on my analysis, 
there was sufficiently strong enough evidence to go ahead and recommend that they launch this experience to all its users.
